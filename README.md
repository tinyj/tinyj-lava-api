Functional interfaces with checked exceptions.

Java's default functional interfaces (i.e. `java.util.function.Function` and
friends) allow for raising checked exception, which basically denies us from
using these neat lambda shorthands for anything that may throw checked
exceptions. tinyj-lava-api is a first step to fix that defining equivalent
functional interfaces with declared checked exceptions.

Additionally tinyj-lava-api defines two exception types. `NoException` is a
marker class that allows to declare a method to not to throw any exception at
all. *This is not enforced by the compiler* though. `WrappedCheckedException`
is just for wrapping checked exceptions. While `new RuntimeException(e)`
achieves the same thing using `WrappedCheckedException` allows for clearer
communication and makes unwrapping of such exceptions much easier.
